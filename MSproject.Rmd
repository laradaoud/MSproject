## Introduction 


Recent events in the world economy have lead to the decline in economic performance in many countries, amongst which is the decline of econommic growth in the European Union (EU).  As a response to these changes,  the EU has made it a priority to reverse this trend through investments that would provide new jobs and create a better educated workforce. Hence, the European Comission (EC) has set up a ‘Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth’ (European Comission, 2010), where a crucial part of investment is to contribute to the education of the next generations: The aim is to reduce the share of early school leavers to below 10% and ensure that at least 40% of the younger generation obtain a tertiary degree. 

The implementation of this strategy would use up siginificant amounts of resources; therefore, ensuring its success is crucial.  However, some factors affect the effectiveness of this strategy by lowering the academic performance of students, despite the investments going into the education system.  In an effort to identify one of those factors, this paper looks into the effect of alcohol consumption on the academic performance of students.  The consequences of high alcohol consumption is a field with a vast amount of literature and scientific studies, all of which point to the health, social and economic effects of alcohol consumption.  For example, a study by Keng and Huffman (2010) has found a relationship between alcohol abuse and poor labor market outcomes.  The choice of alcohol consumption as hindering factor the success of the EC's strategy was therefore motivated to test whether these consequences extend to academic performance as well.

The dataset used for this paper contains information about students in Portugal at the secondary school level. Portugal is among the world's highest alcohol consuming countries worldwide, ranked as the tenth highest alcohol consuming country per capita (Statitsa, 2016). In addition, Portugal is ranked amongst the top five OECD countries with the largest percentage of adults who have not attained secondary education in 2013, with a high percentage of 65% compared to an OECD average of 25%.  This is coupled with the fact that unemployment affected adults without a secondary education more severely than it did those with tertiary education (OECD, 2013).

## Description of Dataset

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
sm <- read.csv("student-mat.csv", sep=';')
str(sm)
summary(sm[,"age"])
```

The dataset examined provides sample data of two secondary schools in Portugal, providing a total of 395 objects (students) and 33 variables (items on information on each student). A list of all variables and their description can be found in Appendix A. The data can be grouped into six areas of information: 

#### 1. General Information
General information about the students include gender, address and age. From the descriptive statistics (section 3) we can derive that the age from the students in this dataset ranges from 15 to 22 years with an average of 16.7 years. The split between male and female students is .....and most student would live in an urban environment (.....), while % live in an rural environment. 

#### 2. Family  
Information in the students families includes the family size, educational background of their parents and their jobs, and the student's guardian. 

#### 3. Education
The education section of this dataset covers the split between the two schools observed, why each student has chosen that particular school, and how long it takes each student to get to school. In addition, it provides information on the student's study time, extra educational support or classes taken, whether they have failed to pass any classes and if the student is involved in extra curricular activities. Finally, there is data on their previous education and aspirations on whether to go into higher education. 

#### 4. Social Life  
The social life section provieds information on activities the student is involved in outside of school. This includes

#### 5. Health 

#### 6. Grades
The grades are split into three grades: the first period (G1), second period (G2) and final grade (G3). For the purpose of thy analysis, G1 and G2 will be neglected.
